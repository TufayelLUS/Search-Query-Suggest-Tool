# Search Query Suggest Tool
This is a python3 based program/script that allows you to search a term and get some search suggestion based on your typed term. Should be useful to those developers who are making web apps using django or it can be used in other programming languages as well.<br>
# What it does?
When you type a keyword in search bar, it will produce relevant search terms for you. For example, if you type "Ban", it will print you all search terms relevant to "Ban".
# How to run?
1. Install python latest version from python website. (make sure to tick on add to path in first installation screen)<br>
2. open command prompt or terminal and type<br>
<code>pip install requests</code><br>
3. double click to execute or you can run it in command prompt by going to the script directory and then typing<br>
<code>python3 suggest-me.py</code><br>
and rest of the instruction follows on your screen! Cheers!<br>
suggest-me-2.py file looks for location only and returns location based search result.
